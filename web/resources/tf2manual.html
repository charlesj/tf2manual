<!--l. 3--><p class="noindent" >This manual sets forth instructions to ensure uniformity and consistency among employees of
Reliable Excavation Demolition (RED) and Builders League United (BLU) as determined by
the Administrator/Announcer. Uniformity and consistency are necessary steps
towards ensuring that combatants are efficient in the execution of their duties on the
battlefield. This manual is applicable to all combat classes. Contained in this manual
are:
      <ul class="itemize1">
      <li class="itemize">General  instructions  that  have  been  determined  by  the  Administrator  to  be
      applicable to all combatants and are a requirement for all involved.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">Descriptions of the different types of battlefields in which combat occurs.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">Instructions  specified  by  the  Administrator  for  specific  combat  classes.  Each
      combat class has mandated strengths and weaknesses and actions by combatants
      must maximize strengths while minimizing weaknesses.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">Team strategies. Success on the battlefield will be determined by the combatants
      who display greater levels of teamwork. As such, teamwork is vital for victory.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">Decorum guidelines. While combatants are expected to be presentable at all times
      the Administrator recognizes that individualization is important. As combatant
      tenure grows, combatants may be awarded &#8221;headgear&#8221; which may be worn on the
      battlefield.</li></ul>
<!--l. 13--><p class="noindent" >Combatants are expected to have this manual in their possession at all times. The
Administrator has the authority to challenge any combatant&#8217;s understanding of the
information contained within. Inadequate understanding by the combatant will result in
an unsatisfactory mark on your official combat record. Followed by death. Good
luck!

<!--l. 72--><p class="noindent" >Combatants enter the battlefield at set points known as spawn points. Before entering these
areas, combatants must choose which class they will play. If combatants wish to change
classes, they may press the &#8221;,&#8221; key on their keyboard and they will be presented a list of
classes from which they can choose. Note that if combatants select a different class while
anywhere else in the map they will be killed by the server (suicide) and have to
wait to re-spawn as the new class (this can be changed in Options Multiplayer
Advanced). However, if combatants select a new class while inside of the spawn
points they will re-spawn as the new class immediately without suiciding. Most
spawn points also contain resupply lockers which replenish health and ammo to full,
instantly.

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2.3   </span> <a 
 id="x1-60002.3"></a>Selecting a Class</h4>
<!--l. 75--><p class="noindent" >On the class selection screen, each class will have a number above it. This number represents
the number of combatants who are already a member of that class. Combatants should take
care that no class is over represented. This maintains balance on the team and ensures that a
team is not missing players in other classes that would serve the current initiative. A
balanced team generally includes a balance of support, defensive, and offensive classes.
For example, a Medic is generally considered to be a useful support class on any
map.

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2.4   </span> <a 
 id="x1-70002.4"></a>Maintaining Health</h4>
<!--l. 79--><p class="noindent" >Throughout the battle, unskilled combatants may find themselves low on health. The
Administrator has provided several solutions to this problem. One way is by providing health
                                                                                    
                                                                                    
packs which can be used to replenish combatant health. There are three types of health
packs: small, medium, and large. They heal 20.5%, 50% and 100%, respectively, and they all
extinguish fire.
<!--l. 81--><p class="noindent" >Health can be replenished by returning to the spawn point (see above) and opening the
supply cabinet installed by the Administrator for these purposes. Teammates playing Medic
(see page <a 
href="#x1-510004.7">46<!--tex4ht:ref: Medic --></a>) can also replenish teammates&#8217; health using their medigun. Teammates playing
Engineer (see page <a 
href="#x1-480004.6">43<!--tex4ht:ref: Engineer --></a>) can build dispensers which can also replenish health. Last, but not
least, a teammate playing Heavy (see page <a 
href="#x1-440004.5">39<!--tex4ht:ref: Heavy --></a>) can throw out his delicious Sandvich which
will replenish 50% of a combatant&#8217;s health. Combatants receiving this generosity should be
sure to show their gratitude.

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2.5   </span> <a 
 id="x1-80002.5"></a>Maintaining Ammunition</h4>
<!--l. 85--><p class="noindent" >Combatants best maintain ammunition so that they will always be prepared for combat.
Ammunition can be resupplied in ways similar to Health. The Administrator has distributed
ammunition packs throughout the map that can be picked up by any class that will increase
their available ammunition. Ammunition packs will also increase the Engineer&#8217;s available
metal supply. Combatants can pick up the weapons of their fallen comrades to use as ammo
or even broken pieces of an Engineer&#8217;s buildings. Engineer&#8217;s dispensers also supply
combatants with ammo without having to wait for ammo packs to re-spawn, at no cost to the
dispenser.

<!--l. 88--><p class="noindent" >The Administrator has provided each class with a base set of weapons for use in combat. As
combat time increases, the Administrator may provide additional weapons to the
combatant through random drops while in combat. These will be given out after
death. Weapons may also be gained via achievement milestones (see page <a 
href="#x1-670006.3">59<!--tex4ht:ref: Achievements --></a>. All
found weapons and items can be viewed by opening the backpack (default key

<!--l. 91--><p class="noindent" >Once a player is given a new weapon for a class (either through random drops, or earned
through achievements), they can choose to equip the item by opening up the load out screen
(default key &#8217;m&#8217;). At the load out screen, one can select the primary, secondary, and
melee weapons (as well as headgear and miscellanious items) to be equipped to the
selected class. Switching back to the default weapons is just as easy. Combatants
can switch weapons as much as they want but the changes will not take effect
until either they die and respawn or they touch a resupply cabinet in the spawn
room.

<!--l. 94--><p class="noindent" >During play, combatants inflict damage to one another through various means of attack. The
damage caused by these attacks is based on the weapon being used and, generally, the
distance to the enemy. Every time a combatant uses their weapon, they have a chance of
producing a critical hit. These critical hits inflict 300% the normal level of damage to an
opponent (i.e. not buildings). Critical hits are identifiable by a team-colored glow around
projectiles and a custom sound upon firing and upon collision with enemy. Critical hits are
often shortened to just &#8221;crits.&#8221;

 id="x1-130002.10"></a>Übercharge</h4>
<!--l. 124--><p class="noindent" >There are two types of &#8221;Übercharge&#8221; that can be created by the Medic. Übercharges involve
the Medic and usually just one other player (the &#8221;patient&#8221;), although skilled Medics may
Übercharge more than one person. Medics continue healing while Übercharged so Übering a
teammate is a great way to save his life if he is about to die, because he gets 8 seconds of
undisrupted healing and invinciblity.
<!--l. 126--><p class="noindent" >
<h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2.10.1   </span> <a 
 id="x1-140002.10.1"></a>Standard Übercharge</h5>
<!--l. 127--><p class="noindent" >A standard Übercharge is a buff deployed for 8 seconds by the Medic on one patient at a time.
While the Übercharge is active, both the Medic and the patient are invulnerable to all
damage (except for Telefraging, see Glossary on page <a 
href="#x1-760007.8">76<!--tex4ht:ref: Glossary --></a>). An Übercharge is a very important
part of game mechanics, potentially allowing a team to overcome highly concentrated
defenses, which would otherwise be impossible to overcome (e.g. well-defended choke points
with sentries, etc.). The Medic can deploy an Übercharge only when his Übercharge meter is
full. The Übercharge meter is filled by healing combatants, and healing combatants who are
wounded fills the meter faster.

<h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2.10.2   </span> <a 
 id="x1-150002.10.2"></a>Kritz Übercharge</h5>
<!--l. 130--><p class="noindent" >The Kritz is a fully-offensive variant of the Übercharge. It is deployed using the Kritzkrieg
instead of the Medigun. Unlike the Übercharge, the Kritz confers no invulnerability to either
the Medic or the patient, instead providing the patient with 100% critical hit chance. It lasts
8 seconds like the Übercharge. The Kritz is especially useful when used on Soldiers, Heavies
and Demomen.

<h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2.10.3   </span> <a 
 id="x1-160002.10.3"></a>Reacting to an Enemy Übercharge or Kritzkrieg</h5>
<!--l. 133--><p class="noindent" >Combatants who face an enemy Übercharge have several options, besides running away. First,
they can become invulnerable by means of either two ways. If there is a Medic with a fully
charged Über of his own, he can &#8221;pop&#8221; it on a fellow teammate and prevent both of their
                                                                                    
                                                                                    
deaths. If a Scout is carrying Bonk Atomic Soda (see Scout page <a 
href="#x1-320004.1">24<!--tex4ht:ref: Scout --></a>), drinking it will make
him invulnerable as well.
<!--l. 135--><p class="noindent" >If a Pyro is carrying the Flamethrower, he can counter Übercharges through the use of his
airblast. He should blast Übercharges away from teammates or sentry positions. Through
repeated use of the airblast, an Übercharge can be completely countered in some
cases.
<!--l. 137--><p class="noindent" >
                                                                                    
                                                                                    
<!--l. 139--><p class="noindent" >Combatants who face an incoming Kritz have fewer options. The most obvious option is to
run and hide for the duration of the Kritz attack. The other option is to try to kill the
vulnerable Medic which will end the Kritz It is important to note that unlike the standard
Übercharge the Kritz does not provide invulnerability, so the Medic can be killed to end the
Kritz.

 id="x1-170002.10.4"></a>Übercharging Multiple Teammates</h5>
<!--l. 142--><p class="noindent" >It is possible to Übercharge several patients by quickly switching between them
during an Übercharge, however the downside is that the charge will drain much more
quickly.

expecting it. They should not panic, but concentrate the attack on the biggest threat, such as
an enemy sentry nest.

<h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2.10.6   </span> <a 
 id="x1-190002.10.6"></a>Deploying an Übercharge</h5>
<!--l. 148--><p class="noindent" >The key to a successful Übercharge deployment is communication. Medics can keep their team
updated on the status of their charge and let someone know when they are about to deploy
the charge. Combatants should inform the Medic if they need to pick up more ammo or
reload before the charge. A charge on someone without ammo is a wasted charge.
Combatants and Medics can work together to find the best time to deploy a charge.
Deploying it too early can waste the charge, and deploying it too late can get them killed
before they are able to use the charge.

<!--l. 2--><p class="noindent" >Throughout combatant tenure, combatants will encounter many types of battlefields.
Generally, combatants should kill those on the other team, while following the teamwork
guidelines (see page <a 
href="#x1-600005">57<!--tex4ht:ref: Team_Strategy --></a>). Navigating an unfamiliar map can be quite hard at first Combatants
should follow the arrows and Blu and Red signs. Combatants should note the different types
of conflict they face upon entering the battlefield:
<!--l. 4--><p class="noindent" >
<h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">3.1   </span> <a 
 id="x1-210003.1"></a>Arena (arena_*)</h4>
<!--l. 5--><p class="noindent" >Arena is a heavily round-based mode where combatants fight in a last-man standing scenario.
There are no supply cabinets inside of spawn points and a very limited number of health
packs. Combatants who die in these battles do not respawn until the beginning of the next
battle. The battle is focused around a center control point that eventually unlocks if the
teams take too long to kill each other. Battles in arena matches tend to be much shorter and
more intense because of these changes. Examples of maps that use this gamemode include
Lumberyard and Ravine.
<!--l. 7--><p class="noindent" >
<h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">3.2   </span> <a 
 id="x1-220003.2"></a>Control Points (cp_*)</h4>
<!--l. 8--><p class="noindent" >There are a number of control points throughout the battlefield. Both teams must try to
capture and/or hold some or all of the points. Combatants work together to capture these
points by occupying the control point and sometimes the area immediately around it, as
marked by a black and yellow line. Certain points capture slower than others, but
having additional compatants of the same team on the point will increase the rate of
capture. The maximum number of combatants on the point that will result in a bonus
is four, but note that a Scout counts as two combatants on a point. There are
two different types of CP maps, attack/defend maps and five control point push
maps.

<!--l. 11--><p class="noindent" >The RED team begins with control of all the points on the map, the BLU team&#8217;s goal is to
take them all before the time limit runs out, while the RED team is trying to hold the
points for the time limit. Each time the BLU team is able to take a point, more
time is added. The number of points can vary depending on the map, between 2
and 5. Some of RED&#8217;s points may begin the game locked and cannot be captured
by BLU until the points before them have been captured, but this also depends
on the map. Examples of maps that use this gamemode include Dustbowl and
Gravelpit.
<!--l. 13--><p class="noindent" >
<h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">3.2.2   </span> <a 
 id="x1-240003.2.2"></a>Five Control Point Push</h5>
<!--l. 14--><p class="noindent" >These maps have 5 control points in a linear fashion and are symmetrical across the center
point. Each team begins the match by spawning on opposite sides of the map. Both teams
are automatically given control of the two points closest to their spawn. Both teams then
have to race out to fight over the center point. The team that is able to win the center point
then tries to push forward onto the opponent&#8217;s side of the map and take the other two points
(in order), while trying to defend the points they have. Points are locked for capture unless
the team owns the point preceding it. The first team to control all 5 points on
the map wins. Examples of maps that use this gamemode include Badlands and
Well.
<!--l. 16--><p class="noindent" >
<h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">3.3   </span> <a 
 id="x1-250003.3"></a>Capture the Flag (ctf_*)</h4>
<!--l. 17--><p class="noindent" >Combatants must bring the intelligence briefcase (aka intel) to a specific point on the map in
order to score points. Capturing the intelligence refers to obtaining the intelligence
by touching it to pick it up and bringing it back to the intelligence room. If the
intelligence-carrier is killed by the opposing team, the intel is dropped on the ground at the
point they were killed. If untouched by team, it will return to the original intel room in a
number of seconds (time varies by map). The icon above the dropped intel is a timer that
displays the time until this occurs. If the intel is touched by another teammate, they will pick
it up and the timer resets. A player can also willingly drop the intel (default key &#8217;L&#8217;) in order
to allow a faster class to pick it up. Arrows on the HUD indicate which direction
the intel is in. When a player captures the intelligence, their team recieves ten
seconds of critical hits. Both teams have identical bases housing their own top secret
briefcase of intel. The goal is to fight into the enemy&#8217;s base to take their intel while
defending one&#8217;s own. Examples of maps that use this gamemode include 2Fort and

<!--l. 20--><p class="noindent" >Capture the central control point and hold it! Once the control point is held by a team for
the required amount of time, it is captured and the team-colored round timer will
begin to run down. If either team&#8217;s timer reaches 0:00 and they have complete
control (meaning the other team is not currently nor has recently attempted a
capture of the point), that team wins. Examples of maps that use this gamemode
include Viaduct and Nucleus. Currently, KOTH is the only game type which allows
bots without advanced action required by the user (see appendix E: Bots on page

<!--l. 23--><p class="noindent" >BLU must escort a large cart full of explosives into the RED base. It is the BLU team&#8217;s job
to push the cart by standing next to it to advance it down the tracks before time runs out.
More time can be earned by reaching the 2 or 3 checkpoints on every map. Standing near the
cart will also heal and replenish attacking combatant ammunition. The more combatants that
stand near the cart, the faster the cart moves, however capture speed does not increase once
three people are pushing the cart. The RED team must try to stop the cart at all costs by
making sure that BLU cannot push the cart. Just one RED combatant standing
near the cart will stop BLU making any progress. If the cart is not moved after 30
seconds of inactivity, the cart will start to slowly move backwards towards the
last checkpoint. Examples of maps that use this gamemode include Goldrush and
Badwater.

example, shooting down will propel him up. However, shooting twice does not propel the
Scout twice as far. Like the Scattergun, the Force-A-Nature (or FAN, as it is often called)
excels at close quarters combat. It has a reduced clip size that only allows two
shots that can be fired more quickly than the scattergun, but will then need to be

      <li class="itemize">The biggest advantage Scouts have is their speed. They move significantly faster

      their opponents and cause distractions.

      <li class="itemize">A unique ability scouts have is known as the double jump. This is the ability to
      jump again once in the air, allowing them to change directions or jump higher.

      <li class="itemize">Scouts can capture points at a rate twice as fast as other classes. This means two
      scouts standing on a capture point will capture in half the time as two Soldiers,
      or a Medic and a Heavy.

      <li class="itemize">Scouts have a low starting health, which means that they will need to be very

      <ul class="itemize1">
      <li class="itemize">Soldier have the ability to use their rockets to propel them to great heights.
      In order to rocket jump, they shoot at their feet while simultaneously jumping.
      Jumping in this manner can enable Soldiers to reach areas inaccessible to other
      classes. Rocket jumping can be used to surprise enemy combatants and travel at
      higher speeds over the battlefield. While engaging the enemy, Soldiers can rocket
      jump and then rain rockets down on enemy combatants while in the air. Rocket
      jumping does cause the Soldier to damage himself, but it does so at a lower rate
      than damage to others. With correct timing, jumping and crouching will minimize
      this damage. The Soldiers &#8221;Gunboats&#8221; unlockable weapon, which replaces the
      shotgun, allows the soldier to rocket jump without taking nearly as much damage.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">Soldiers should fire their rockets at the feet of their opponents. By firing at their
      feet instead of their body, the chance of causeing damage is increased, as the
      rocket will certainly explode once it hits the ground. A rocket fired at the body of
      an opponent could miss, and not explode for a long distance, causing no damage
      at all. Accurate shots will throw the opponent up in the air, who can then be
      juggled by firing additional rockets at the spot where they will land. Another
      option the Soldier has is to switch to their shotgun and finish off their opponent
      with that weapon.
      </li>
                                                                                    
                                                                                    
      <li class="itemize">The Soldier is great at taking down sentries. Combatants can peek out from
      around a corner, fire a rocket, and retreat before an enemy sentry can taget them.
      Because rockets have a virtually unlimited range and Soldiers can also stand
      outside the range of enemy sentries to take them down. Firing at the walls or
      ground behind an enemy sentry is a good way to dislodge a stubborn Engineer.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">Some more advanced tactics for Soldiers include air shots (shooting enemies who
      are in the air with the rocket launcher), horizontal rocket jumping, crouch rocket
      jumping and effective use of the Equalizer.

      <ul class="itemize1">
      <li class="itemize">The Sniper&#8217;s main goal should be taking out the most valuable enemy targets.
      One tactic is to make sure that the opposing team&#8217;s Medic is killed first, as this
      will keep the enemy from being healed, and can prevent an enemy Übercharge.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">While using the Sniper Rifle, long range is best. If enemies advance too quickly
      to get long-distance shots, consider switching to the Huntsman.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">Snipers should find a good vantage point from which to fire their Sniper Rile.
      This will give him an edge over his enemies but may make him an isolated target
      for a Spy.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">Having  &#8217;sniper-battles&#8217;  with  enemy  Snipers  is  often  pointless  and  does  not
      contribute much to the team.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">Throwing Jarate on several enemies at once can stop a rush, or even turn the tide
      of the battle.

      landing.

Spy is able to disguise as any of the nine classes on either team. When they are
disguised, they are mostly indistinguishable. Spies appear to wear a paper mask to their
fellow teammates. Firing a weapon will automatically remove any disguise, with the
exception of the electro-sapper. A disguised Spy is able to fool enemy Engineer&#8217;s
buildings, allowing him to heal from dispensers and carts, take teleporters, and not be
attacked by sentries. Disguised spies can also be healed (and even Übered) by enemy
Medics. However, when wearing a disguise, the spy will still receive damage from any
enemy that may fire upon him; this is one of the only ways the enemy can tell a
spy.

<!--l. 44--><p class="noindent" ><span class="underline">Invisibility Watches and Tactics</span></div>
<!--l. 47--><p class="noindent" >Spies have the capability of cloaking themselves by using the alternative fire button, but
there are a few things combatants should know before they start sneaking behind enemy
lines. The watches are not perfect, they take a few moments to make the Spy completely
invisible, and if the Spy bumps into an enemy while cloaked, he will be partly visible. There
are three kinds of watches that a Spy can equip, each catering to a different play
style:
      <ul class="itemize1">
      <li class="itemize"><span 
class="cmbx-12">Invisibility  Watch</span>:  This  watch  can  be  replenished  with  metal/ammo  (See
      Maintaining Ammunition section on <a 
href="#x1-80002.5">12<!--tex4ht:ref: Maintaining_Ammunition --></a>), or it will recharge by not using it. It
      gives the Spy 9 second of full invisibility and it takes about 33 seconds to fully
      recharge by standing still, but in situations where metal is abundant this watch
      is a much needed asset to a Spy&#8217;s arsenal.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize"><span 
class="cmbx-12">Cloak and Dagger*</span>:This watch is motion based. It is the only watch of the
      three that can&#8217;t be recharged with metal and ammo crates. This is because it only
                                                                                    
                                                                                    
      drains its charge when the Spy cloaked and moving. It can be recharged slowly by
      standing still while cloaked or by being uncloaked. By standing still, a Spy can be
      under the cloak indefinitely. Cload and Dagger Spies should focus on not being
      seen at all, as running away is difficult with such limited cloak movement range.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize"><span 
class="cmbx-12">Dead Ringer*</span>: This watch works differently than the other two. When pulling
      this watch out, the Spy will not automatically cloak. Instead, the next damage
      the Spy takes will cause the watch to simultaneously activate cloaking and drop
      a fake body for the other team to see, feigning a death. It also negates 90% of
      the damage that would be taken while cloaked. Be warned though, this watch
      has a short cloak time and makes a loud noise when uncloaked, drawing others&#8217;
      attention. Dead Ringer Spies must focus on using their disguise more than their
      cloak, and only using the ability to feign death as an escape measure.</li></ul>

<!--l. 8--><p class="noindent" >A good team communicates well. Note that some players will have microphones while others
will not - a combatant that does not have a microphone should use their voice menu
commands to the best of their capacity. A good example of this would be having potential
Über targets call out &#8221;Medic&#8221; when they want an Übercharge to be activated. Call out sentry
positions, Spies, and unexpected enemy tactics. Combatants can let the Medic know when
they are ready to receive an Übercharge, or need healing. Combatants should be aware of the
presence of Spies and call out their position and disguise, if possible. They should try to pay
attention to teammates &#8211; if they need healing too, and the Medic is working through
them, be patient and don&#8217;t keep pressing the key (by default, &#8221;e&#8221;) that calls the
doctor (it gets annoying for the Medic). They should be aware that while some
servers have Team-Talk on, meaning only teammates can hear and speak to each
other, others use All-Talk, meaning all players can communicate with each other
regardless of team. If playing on an All-Talk server, it might be wise to refrain
from giving out too much information, as it could aid the other team in forming
appropriate countermeasures. Especially tricky combatants could use All-Talk to
their advantage by giving out false information. &#8221;You are trying my patience!&#8221;

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">5.2   </span> <a 
 id="x1-620005.2"></a>Engineer-related Etiquette</h4>
<!--l. 12--><p class="noindent" >Upgrade the Engineer&#8217;s buildings. During the setup phase all players, except for Medics,
should consider switching to Engineer and helping them build their buildings. If they are far
away from spawn, combatants can help an Engineer by upgrading his building until they are
out of metal, then kill themselves so that the Engineer can collect an additional 100
                                                                                    
                                                                                    
metal from their dropped weapons. (A player can suicide by typing explode into the
console)
<!--l. 15--><p class="noindent" >Teleporter Queuing. If two combatants reach the teleporter at the same time, they shouldn&#8217;t
waste time fighting over it. It is common courtesy to let Engineers (to keep thier buildings
alive) and Medics (to keep people on the front lines alive) go before you. After
Engineers and Medics, slower classes benefit more from using teleporters. Scouts should
rarely use teleporters because they can run to the front lines very quickly without
it.
<!--l. 17--><p class="noindent" >Engineers should place teleporter entrances immediately outside of the spawn point.
<!--l. 19--><p class="noindent" >Teammates should try to protect the Engineer&#8217;s sentries, teleporters, and dispenser.
<!--l. 21--><p class="noindent" >
<h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">5.3   </span> <a 
 id="x1-630005.3"></a>Other Information</h4>
<!--l. 22--><p class="noindent" >Medics are a neccessary component of a successful team. If a team is having a difficult time
progressing, a Medic should prioritize building up an Übercharge to break through a strong
defensive opposition. (see the section on Übercharge in General Instructions page
<a 
href="#x1-130002.10">16<!--tex4ht:ref: Ubercharge --></a>).
<!--l. 24--><p class="noindent" >Spies are generally disguised as members of their opposing team. Using a weapon on an
enemy Spy will cause damage, while using a weapon on a teammate will not. For this reason
it is highly recommended that players &#8217;Spy-check&#8217; any &#8217;teammate&#8217; they suspect may be
a Spy by firing their weapons at him. Teammates can let each other know they
are not a Spy by taunting, firing their weapons, switching weapons, or using their
microphone. Friendly teammates cannot collide with players on their own team, and will
instead walk through them. However, they can collide with enemy spies disguised as
members of their team. Thusly it is advised that they attempt to walk through
everyone.
<!--l. 26--><p class="noindent" >If needed,players should take the time to &#8217;regroup&#8217; and re-form. Although it sacrifices time
and possibly ground to the enemy, it allows the players to focus and work together as a team
again.

are actually connected. Bots are also useful for those who wish to practice on their own. This
can be done by starting up a local server and loading any of Valve&#8217;s King of the Hill TF2
maps. These maps are Viaduct, Nucleus, and Sawmill. (While Harvest is also an official
KOTH map, it does not have Bot support.) Once the server is started, open up a console and
