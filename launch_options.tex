\subsection{Appendix B - Launch Options}
Combatants can alter the way they are launched into battle. They do this by right-clicking "Team Fortress 2" in their library and selecting "Properties". Here, they navigate to "Launch options", found in the "General" tab.

The following is a list of some of the more commonly used options and the launch flag used to trigger them:

Remove the Valve introduction video:
\begin{lstlisting}
-novid
\end{lstlisting}
Open the console when the game opens:
\begin{lstlisting}
-console
\end{lstlisting}
Launche the game in a window:
\begin{lstlisting}
-window
\end{lstlisting}
Remove the window border in windowed mode:
\begin{lstlisting}
-noborder
\end{lstlisting}
Open the game in fullscreen mode:
\begin{lstlisting}
-full
\end{lstlisting}
Manually set the horizontal resolution of the window:
\begin{lstlisting}
-width (or -w)
\end{lstlisting}
Manually set the vertical resolution of the window:
\begin{lstlisting}
-height (or -h)
\end{lstlisting}
Manually set the amount of RAM the game will use:
\begin{lstlisting}
-heapsize [kilobytes]
\end{lstlisting}

Tip: Using a borderless window (with "-window -noborder") is useful for quickly switching applications (a.k.a "alt+tabbing").  A borderless window set to the exact resolution of the monitor's desktop will look exactly the same as the default full screen mode.
