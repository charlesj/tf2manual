\subsection{Appendix B - Launch Options}
Combatants can alter the way they are launched into battle. They do this by right-clicking ``Team Fortress 2" in their library and selecting ``Properties". Here, they navigate to ``Launch options", found in the ``General" tab.

The following is a list of some of the more commonly used options and the launch flag used to trigger them:

\begin{table}[h!b!p!]
\caption{Common Launch Options}
\begin{tabular}{|l|p{10.5cm}|}
	\hline
		Option & Description\\
	\hline
	\texttt{-novid}&Remove the Valve introduction video\\
	\texttt{-console}&Open the console when the game opens\\
	\texttt{-window}&Launch the game in a window\\
	\texttt{-noborder}&Remove the window border in windowed mode\\
	\texttt{-full}&Open the game in fullscreen mode\\
	\texttt{-width (or -w)}&Manually set the width resolution of the window\\
	\texttt{-height (or -h)}&Manually set the horizontal resolution of the window\\
	\texttt{-heapsize [kilobytes]}&Manually set the amount of RAM the game will use\\
	\texttt{-dxlevel [81 or 95]}&Sets the game to launch using DirectX 8.1 or 9c\\

  	\hline
\end{tabular}
\label{table_launch_options}
\end{table}

Tip: Using a borderless window (with ``-window -noborder") is useful for quickly switching applications (a.k.a ``alt+tabbing").  A borderless window set to the exact resolution of the monitor's desktop will look exactly the same as the default full screen mode.
