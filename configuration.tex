\subsection{Appendix C - Configuration Files}
There are two types of configuration files: general and class specific. General configurations apply to all classes, while class specific configurations apply only to that class. 
Example script, for servers with both Team-Talk and All-Talk:

alias +teamonly "+teamtalk;+voicerecord"
alias -teamonly "-teamtalk;-voicerecord"
bind f +teamonly
bind v +voicerecord
voice\_loopback 1

This script will find the "f" key to Team-Talk only, so only teammate communication will be enabled, while "v" will be for communication with both teams.  Finally, it will play back personal voice communications.
