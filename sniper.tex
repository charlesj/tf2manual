\subsection{Sniper}
Bio
In his former life as a tracker of dangerous game in the unforgiving Australian outback, the Sniper would spend months by himself. Prolonged isolation taught him a valuable lesson: You don't have to rely on other people if you never miss.

Health: 125

Purpose
Area denial, eliminating high-value targets.

Weapons
Primary
Sniper rifle: Zoom in using alt-fire to do more damage. The longer the rifle zoomed in, the more damage a shot will do. Headshots deal massive amounts of damage.
Huntsman*: Use this bow and arrow at closer range. Hold the fire button to pull back the string and ready the arrow for release. Holding fire for too long will cause the arrow to fire at a random angle when the fire button is released. The arrow can be unnocked by clicking the secondary fire button.

Secondary
SMG: Best used when enemies are too close to snipe. Be careful though, as ammunition is limited.
Jarate*: Throw Jarate onto enemies. Any enemies within the splash radius will take mini-crits for 10 seconds, unless they jump into water. Jarate will also reveal cloaked spies that are in the splash radius. In addition, Jarate victims cannot fire critical hits or mini crits from the effects of an item specific buff.
Razorback*: The Razorback will block a single backstab from a Spy, and will not allow the Spy to attack for 2 seconds. After blocking the stab, the razorback will break, having no effect on subsequent backstabs.

Melee
Kukri: The Kukri is a general melee weapon. Use the Kukri when enemies are too close for comfort, or to deter spies.
Tribalman's Shiv**: This kukri replacement causes opponents to bleed out for 8 seconds, but at a price. It causes just over a third less damage than the kukri.

Tactics
HUD: When zoomed with the Sniper rifle, bars will appear on the screen. These bars reflect the relative damage a shot will inflict on an enemy, and will charge the longer the aim is held. If charged to full, a Sniper does substantial damage body shots (can kill weaker classes), or headshots that kill all classes, including an over-healed Heavy.

The Sniper is a support class, this means the Sniper's main goal should be taking out the most valuable enemy targets. One tactic is to make sure that the opposing team's Medic is killed first, as this will keep the enemy from being healed, and can prevent an enemy Ãœbercharge.

While using the Sniper Rifle, long range is best. If enemies advance too quickly to get long-distance shots, consider switching to the Huntsman.

Throwing Jarate on several enemies at once can stop a rush, or even turn the tide of the battle.

The Huntsman string can be pulled back while in mid-air, then released upon landing.

The Huntsman's arrow can be lit by a friendly Pyro. If an enemy is hit by this flaming arrow, they will burst into flames!
