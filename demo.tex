\subsection{Demoman}
\label{Demoman}
{\bf Bio}:
A fierce temper, a fascination with all things explosive, and a terrible plan to kill the Loch Ness Monster cost the six year old Demoman his original set of adoptive parents. Later, back at the Crypt Grammar School for Orphans near Ullapool in the Scottish Highlands, the boy's bomb-making skills improved dramatically. His disposition and total number of intact eyeballs, however, did not.

{\bf Health}: 175 HP

{\bf Purpose}
Traps, defense, area denial, destruction of sentry nests

\subsubsection {Weapons}

\underline {Primary}

{\bf Grenade Launcher}: The Demoman's trusty sidekick. It fires projectile explosives, each equipped with a 3 second fuse that cause blast damage when they explode. It can be used to take down enemies and sentries alike. The damage done by the grenades can also do damage to the Demoman himself if he gets too close to them. Grenades explode instantly upon enemy contact.

{\bf Sticky Bomb Launcher}: Launches up to 8 small spiked explosives that can stick to almost anything. Hitting alt-fire detonates all placed sticky explosives. Stickies can be detonated in mid air before they land; known as "air burst", a tactic that is highly effective when mastered. Stickies can be destroyed by enemies by shooting at them once they have landed on something. If the Demoman dies with stickies deployed but undetonated, the stikies will dissolve harmlessly into dust. Sticky bombs can also be used to "sticky jump", see the tactics section for more information. 

{\bf Chargin' Targe*}: This is a shield that partially protects combatants from fire and explosive damage. Additionally, it can be used to quickly charge in a straight line. This can be done by pressing the alternative fire button while the shield is equipped. After charging a certain distance, the demo gets a crit on any attack done while still charging. If the demo is able to charge directly into an enemy the impact will also do damage.

{\bf Scottish Resistance*}: Similar to the regular sticky launcher, but has the ability to place up to 14 bombs. In order to detonate the bombs with the Scottish Resistance, the bombs must be in the center of the player's screen when alt-fire is pressed. This allows players to detonate them in groups. The downside is that they take longer to arm.

\underline {Melee}
\end {center}

{\bf Bottle}: The starting melee weapon. It's a bottle of booze. The bottle will break if struck against another object when the player gets a critical hit. A broken bottle does no extra damage.

{\bf Eyelander*}: It's a big sword that has twice the range of a normal melee weapon. Landing a killing blow with this weapon will cut off the unfortunate victim's head. Each head will reward the Demo with an 8\% increase in speed as well as 15 extra hit points. Combatants gain this reward for the first 4 enemy heads taken, but it will reduce initial health to 150.

{\bf Pain Train**}: Board with a railroad spike through it. Doubles capture speed when equipped. As such, it is only useful in game modes which involve capping points or pushing the cart. It increases combatant vulnerability to bullets by 10\%.

{\bf Scotsman's Skullcutter**}: This weapon is a large, double sided axe.  It deals one fifth more damage than the bottle, but makes the combatant travel 15\% slower, due to its bulk.


\subsubsection {Tactics}
\begin {itemize}
\item A Demo must remember to keep the grenade launcher fully loaded as it can only hold 4 grenades at a time.

\item Sticky bombs can be used to â€œsticky jump," which is similar in some ways to the Soldier's rocket jumping.  In order to sticky jump, a demoman shoots a sticky bomb, stands on top of it, and then simultaneously jumps and detonates the bomb. This has the result of flinging the combatant through the air.  Sticky jumping can be an effective way of moving quickly through the map, especially in control point maps, where the time it takes to get to the center point can be vital to the outcome of the battle.

\item Demos excel at taking out sentry guns. Three stickies in close proximity to a gun will destroy even a level 3 sentry instantly upon detonation.

\item The sticky launcher can be used as an assault weapon by lobbing stickies towards the enemy and detonating them in the air when they get close.

\item Using the arch of both the sticky launcher and the grenade launcher, a demo has the ability to fire while behind cover, or attack well defended sentries from a different angle.
