\section{General Instructions}
\label{general_instructions}

These Instruction have been determined by the Administrator to be applicable to all combatants and are a requirement for all involved. 

\subsection{Keyboard Controls}
Combatants have a standardized way for controlling conduct on the battlefield:

\begin{table}[h!b!p!]
\caption{Common Actions}
\begin{tabular}{|c|l|}
	\hline
		Key & Action\\
	\hline
	\texttt{w}&Move Forward\\
	\texttt{a}&Strafe Left\\
	\texttt{d}&Strafe Right\\
	\texttt{s}&Move Backward\\
	\texttt{Space}&Jump\\
	\texttt{Ctrl}&Crouch\\
	\texttt{g}&Taunt\\
  	\hline
\end{tabular}
\label{table_common_actions}
\end{table}

\begin{table}[h!b!p!]

\end{tabular}
\label{table_common_actions}
\end{table}

\begin{table}[h!b!p!]

\begin{tabular}{|c|l|}
	\hline

	\texttt{,}&Change Class\\
	\texttt{.}&Change Team\\
  	\hline
\end{tabular}
\label{table_common_actions}
\end{table}

Combatants may wish to customize these controls and can do so through the options menu, the console, or use configuration files. See Appendix A - Console on {{pageref}} for more information.

\subsection{Spawn Points \& Spawning}
Combatants enter the battlefield at set points known as spawn points. Before entering these areas, combatants must choose which class they will play. If combatants wish to change classes, they may press the "," key on their keyboard and they will be presented a list of classes from which they can choose. Note that if combatants select a different class while anywhere else in the map they will be killed by the server (suicide) and have to wait to re-spawn as the new class (this can be changed in Options>Multiplayer>Advanced). However, if combatants select a new class while inside of the spawn points they will re-spawn as the new class immediately without suiciding. Most spawn points also contain resupply lockers which replenish health and ammo to full, instantly.

\subsection{Selecting a Class}
On the class selection screen, each class will have a number above it. This number represents the number of their fellow combatants who are already a member of that class. Combatants should take care that no class is over-represented.  This maintains balance on the team and ensures that a team is not missing players in other classes that would serve the current initiative. A balanced team generally includes a balance of support, defensive, and offensive classes. For example, a Medic is generally considered to be a useful support class on any map.

\subsection{Maintaining Health}
Throughout the battle, unskilled combatants may find themselves low on health.  The Administrator has provided several solutions to this problem.  One way is by providing health packs which can be used to replenish combatant health.  There are three types of health packs: small, medium, and large.  They heal 20.5\%, 50\% and 100\%, respectively.

Health may be replenished by returning to the spawn point (see {{pageref}}) and opening the supply cabinet installed by the Administrator for these purposes. Teammates playing Medic (see {{pageref}}) can also replenish teammates' health using their medigun. Teammates playing Engineer (see {{pageref}}) can build dispensers which can also replenish health. Last, but not least, a teammate playing Heavy (see {{pageref}}) can throw out his delicious Sandvich which will replenish 125 health.  Combatants receiving this generosity should be sure to show their gratitude.

\subsection{Maintaining Ammunition}
Combatants will maintain ammunition so that they will always be prepared for combat.  Ammunition can be resupplied in ways similar to Health.  The Administrator has distributed ammunition packs throughout the map that can be picked up by any class that will increase their available ammunition.  Ammunition packs will also increase the Engineer's available metal.  Engineer's dispensers also supply combatants with ammo without having to wait for ammo packs to re-spawn, at no cost to the dispenser.

\subsection{Weapon Drops}
The Administrator has provided each class with a base set of weapons for use in combat.  As combat time increases, the Administrator may provide additional weapons to the combatant through random drops while in combat. These will be given out after death.  Weapons may also be gained via achievement milestones. All found weapons and items can be viewed by opening the backpack (default key 'n'). 

\subsection{Changing Loadout}
Once a player is given a new weapon for a class (either through random drops, or earned through achievements), they can choose to equip the item by opening up the load out screen (default key 'm'). At the load out screen, one can select the primary, secondary, and melee weapons (as well as headgear and other items) to be equipped to the selected class.  Switching back to the default weapons is just as easy. Combatants can switch weapons as much as they want but the changes will not take effect until either they die and respawn or they touch a resupply cabinet in the spawn room.
