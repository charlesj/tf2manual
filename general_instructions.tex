\section{General Instructions}
\label{general_instructions}

These Instruction have been determined by the Administrator to be applicable to all combatants and are a requirement for all involved. 

\subsection{Keyboard Controls}
Combatants have a standardized way for controlling conduct on the battlefield:

\begin{table}[h!b!p!]
\caption{Common Actions}
\begin{tabular}{|c|l|}
	\hline
		Key & Action\\
	\hline
	\texttt{w}&Move Forward\\
	\texttt{a}&Strafe Left\\
	\texttt{d}&Strafe Right\\
	\texttt{s}&Move Backward\\
	\texttt{Space}&Jump\\
	\texttt{Ctrl}&Crouch\\
	\texttt{g}&Taunt\\
  	\hline
\end{tabular}
\label{table_common_actions}
\end{table}

\begin{table}[h!b!p!]
\caption{Voice Commands}
\begin{tabular}{|c|l|}
	\hline
		Key & Action\\
	\hline
	\texttt{e}&Call for Medic\\
	\texttt{z}&Bring up Voice Menu 1\\
	\texttt{x}&Bring up Voice Menu 2\\
	\texttt{c}&Bring up Voice Menu 3\\
  	\hline
\end{tabular}
\label{table_common_actions}
\end{table}

\begin{table}[h!b!p!]
\caption{Gameplay Actions}
\begin{tabular}{|c|l|}
	\hline
		Key & Action\\
	\hline
	\texttt{n}&Open Backpack\\
	\texttt{m}&Change Weapon Loadout\\
	\texttt{,}&Change Class\\
	\texttt{.}&Change Team\\
  	\hline
\end{tabular}
\label{table_common_actions}
\end{table}

Combatants may wish to customize these controls and can do so through the options menu, the console, or use configuration files. See Appendix A - Console on {{pageref}} for more information.

\subsection{Spawn Points \& Spawning}
Combatants enter the battlefield at set points known as spawn points. Before entering these areas, combatants must choose which class they will play. If combatants wish to change classes, they may press the "," key on their keyboard and they will be presented a list of classes from which they can choose. Note that if combatants select a different class while anywhere else in the map they will be killed by the server (suicide) and have to wait to re-spawn as the new class (this can be changed in Options>Multiplayer>Advanced). However, if combatants select a new class while inside of the spawn points they will re-spawn as the new class immediately without suiciding. Most spawn points also contain resupply lockers which replenish health and ammo to full, instantly.

\subsection{Selecting a Class}
On the class selection screen, each class will have a number above it. This number represents the number of their fellow combatants who are already a member of that class. Combatants should take care that no class is over-represented.  This maintains balance on the team and ensures that a team is not missing players in other classes that would serve the current initiative. A balanced team generally includes a balance of support, defensive, and offensive classes. For example, a Medic is generally considered to be a useful support class on any map.

\subsection{Maintaining Health}
Throughout the battle, unskilled combatants may find themselves low on health.  The Administrator has provided several solutions to this problem.  One way is by providing health packs which can be used to replenish combatant health.  There are three types of health packs: small, medium, and large.  They heal 20.5\%, 50\% and 100\%, respectively.

Health may be replenished by returning to the spawn point (see {{pageref}}) and opening the supply cabinet installed by the Administrator for these purposes. Teammates playing Medic (see {{pageref}}) can also replenish teammates' health using their medigun. Teammates playing Engineer (see {{pageref}}) can build dispensers which can also replenish health. Last, but not least, a teammate playing Heavy (see {{pageref}}) can throw out his delicious Sandvich which will replenish 125 health.  Combatants receiving this generosity should be sure to show their gratitude.
